          The goal of this exercise is to implement a <code>usePrevious</code>{" "}
          hook, to handle the common use case of finding out what the value of
          something was on the previous render.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>Desired usage:</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          {`
                const previousCount = usePrevious(count);

                return (
                  <p>
                    Count is now {count}.
                    Count on last render was {previousCount}.
                  </p>
                );
        `}
        </code>
